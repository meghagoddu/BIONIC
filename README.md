BIONIC
BIONIC leverages advanced AI to enhance physiotherapy for individuals with prosthetic limbs, integrating multiple sophisticated technologies. The platform includes a secure medical document upload feature, enabling patients to share detailed medical histories and prosthetic specifications. This information is processed by our generative AI to create highly personalized feedback and physical therapy plans. Patients can then utilize our computer vision-enhanced physiotherapy tool, which allows them to record videos of their therapeutic exercises or range of motion. The AI analyzes these recordings, providing precise biomechanical feedback and recommendations for improving technique and alignment.

Moreover, BIONIC features an interactive voice chatbot designed to answer technical queries, offer tailored exercise modifications, and facilitate efficient scheduling of appointments with healthcare providers. This AI-driven approach automates critical aspects of the physiotherapy process, allowing for continuous monitoring and real-time adjustments without the need for frequent in-person check-ins. By doing so, BIONIC optimizes the allocation of hospital resources, enhances patient adherence to rehabilitation protocols, and ensures each patient receives personalized, data-driven care throughout their recovery journey. Additionally, the platform has the potential to significantly reduce the time required for physical therapy plans to be effective, accelerating patient progress and improving overall outcomes. Importantly, BIONIC increases patient independence and reduces the load on surrounding family members, addressing the crucial need for autonomy and self-sufficiency following the loss of a limb.
